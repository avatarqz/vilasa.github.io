# 论文1. 变通戒律却安然无恙
作者：佩特拉·基弗-普尔茨（Petra Kieffer-Pülz）  
摘要：本文聚焦上座部律典中波罗夷第二条盗窃法，探究其文本构成与发展脉络。首先分析律典中盗窃规则的时序层级，包括根本规定、补充条款及相关解释；其次考察《善见律毗婆沙》《岛史》等注释文献对盗窃类型的分类，这类分类整合了早期注释的核心信息；最后探讨早期注释家针对盗窃行为形成的罪业吸收机制。研究指出，盗窃法的规则结构包含序故事、根本规定、词语解析、案例辨析等模块，且存在特殊的补充章节；注释文献将盗窃归纳为二十五种类型，涵盖行为方式、实施手段等多个维度；罪业吸收机制则区分先行行为与同时行为，明确不同阶段罪业的归责逻辑。

Title：Stretching the Vinaya Rules and Getting Away with It  
Author：Petra Kieffer-Pülz  
Abstract：This article focuses on the law of theft, which belongs to the second Pārajika rule in the Theravāda Vinaya, exploring its textual composition and developmental context. Firstly, it analyzes the chronological layers of the theft rules in the Vinaya, including the fundamental provisions, supplementary clauses, and related explanations. Secondly, it investigates the classification of theft types in commentarial literature such as the Samantapāsādikā and the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī, which integrate core information from early commentaries. Finally, it discusses the mechanism of offence absorption developed by early Aṭṭhakathākāras for theft. The study points out that the structural framework of the theft law includes introductory stories, fundamental regulations, word analysis, casuistry, and other modules, with special supplementary sections. The commentarial literature classifies theft into twenty-five types, covering multiple dimensions such as modes of conduct and means of implementation. The offence absorption mechanism distinguishes between preceding actions and simultaneous actions, clarifying the imputation logic of offences at different stages.

# 论文2. 《苏斯玛经》与慧解脱阿罗汉
作者：比丘菩提（Bhikkhu Bodhi）  
摘要：《苏斯玛经》作为《相应部》中的短篇经文，以戏剧化情节聚焦慧解脱阿罗汉的性质这一核心教义议题——此类阿罗汉凭借智慧的特殊效用获得解脱，无需在定学领域达到卓越成就。该经的巴利语版本存有三个汉译平行本，通过对比巴利语经文与汉译版本，可窥见佛教部派在文本传播早期对经中教义问题的不同思考。本文以巴利语版本（S 12:70）为核心，先概述经文情节，再基于核心文本探讨慧解脱阿罗汉的主题，进而分析各汉译版本对该主题的阐释，为后续深入研究经文中涉及慧解脱阿罗汉地位的两种知识奠定基础。

Title：The Susīma-sutta and the Wisdom-Liberated Arahant  
Author：Bhikkhu Bodhi  
Abstract：The Susīma-sutta, a short discourse of the Saṃyutta-nikāya, uses a dramatic plot to focus on the doctrinal topic of the nature of the paññāvimutta arahant—one who attains liberation through the special efficacy of wisdom without reaching extraordinary distinction in samādhi. The Pāli version has three parallels preserved in Chinese translation, and comparing the Pāli discourse with its Chinese counterparts allows us to see how Buddhist schools were already contemplating different solutions to the doctrinal problem raised by the sutta in an early stage of textual transmission. Taking the Pāli version (S 12:70) as the primary basis, this article first presents a summary of the plot, then explores the theme of the "arahant liberated by wisdom" based on the primary text, followed by a discussion of its treatment in the Chinese versions, laying the groundwork for further research on the two knowledges contributing to the status of the wisdom-liberated arahant.  
Keywords：Susīma-sutta；wisdom-liberated arahant；Pāli canon；Chinese parallel texts；Buddhist schools

# 论文3. 关于异端历法与《迦拉卡查尔雅故事》中一处有争议的解读
作者：保罗·邓达斯（Paul Dundas）  
摘要：本文聚焦非婆罗门传统（佛教与耆那教）的仪式历法体系，结合K.R.诺曼对巴利语圣典及上座部佛教文本传统的研究方法，将巴利语置于更广泛的中古印度雅利安方言语境中考察。文章首先梳理早期沙门团体每月特定日期集会宣讲教义、举行净化与团结仪式的传统，对比佛教与耆那教对“布萨日”的记载；其次探讨阴历与阴阳合历的更替对两派历法的影响，分析说一切有部与上座部在历法选择上的宗派身份建构；最后以耆那教教师迦拉卡（466年）改革历法的记载为核心，结合《迦拉卡查尔雅故事》的不同版本，辨析经文中关于半月忏悔仪式日期从满月日（十五日）改为十四日的争议性解读，揭示历法变革背后的社会、宗教因素。  
关键词：异端历法；《迦拉卡查尔雅故事》；耆那教；佛教；布萨日  
Title：A Note on the Heterodox Calendar and a Disputed Reading in the Kālakācāryakathā  
Author：Paul Dundas  
Abstract：This article focuses on the ritual calendar systems of non-Brahmanical traditions (Buddhism and Jainism). Drawing on K.R. Norman's research method on the Pāli Canon and Theravāda Buddhist textual tradition, it examines Pāli within the broader context of Middle Indo-Aryan dialects. Firstly, it sorts out the tradition of early śramaṇa groups assembling on specific dates of the month to preach their doctrines and perform communal rituals of purification and solidarity, comparing the records of "uposatha/posaha" in Buddhism and Jainism. Secondly, it explores the impact of the replacement of the lunar calendar with the lunisolar calendar on the calendars of both traditions, analyzing the sectarian identity construction of the Sarvāstivādins and Theravādins in calendar selection. Finally, centering on the records of the Jain teacher Kālaka's calendar reform (466 C.E.) and combining different versions of the Kālakācāryakathā, it analyzes the disputed reading in the text regarding the change of the date of the fortnightly pratikramaṇa ritual from the full-moon day (15th) to the 14th, revealing the social and religious factors behind the calendar reform.  
Keywords：heterodox calendar；Kālakācāryakathā；Jainism；Buddhism；uposatha/posaha

# 论文4. 读者须知
作者：玛格丽特·科恩（Margaret Cone）  
摘要：在巴利圣典协会成立125周年之际，本文反思该协会的学术遗产与未来发展方向。作者指出，协会早期学者编纂的巴利语文本、注释、译本、词典及语法著作虽为巴利语与上座部佛教研究奠定基础，但多属开拓性工作，存在诸多可完善之处。基于《巴利语词典》（DOP）的编纂经验，作者发现现有巴利语圣典版本存在大量可疑或错误解读，部分源于对少数手稿的依赖、对不同传承的忽视或校勘者的语言局限。文章呼吁重新校勘圣典与注释文本，制定统一的拼写和标点规范；基于新校本修订语法著作与词典；最终产出准确、可读、可信的译本，强调巴利语研究应兼具语言知识、印度学背景与宗教学视野，避免盲目依赖传统成果。  
关键词：巴利圣典协会；文本校勘；巴利语研究；学术遗产；文献解读  
Title：caveat lector  
Author：Margaret Cone  
Abstract：On the occasion of the 125th anniversary of the founding of the Pali Text Society, this article reflects on the Society's academic heritage and future development direction. The author points out that while the Pāli texts, commentaries, translations, dictionaries, and grammatical works compiled by the Society's early scholars laid the foundation for Pāli and Theravāda Buddhist studies, most are pioneering works with many room for improvement. Based on the experience of compiling A Dictionary of Pāli (DOP), the author finds that existing editions of Pāli canonical texts contain numerous questionable or erroneous readings, partly due to reliance on a few manuscripts, neglect of different traditions, or the linguistic limitations of editors. The article calls for the re-edition of canonical and commentarial texts with unified spelling and punctuation conventions; the revision of grammatical works and dictionaries based on new editions; and the eventual production of accurate, readable, and trustworthy translations. It emphasizes that Pāli studies should integrate linguistic knowledge, Indological background, and religious studies perspectives, avoiding blind reliance on traditional achievements.

# 论文5. 两种律典传统中佛教比丘赡养父母的义务
作者：格雷戈里·肖彭（Gregory Schopen）  
摘要：本文考察上座部与说一切有部律典中关于比丘赡养父母的规定，揭示两派在该议题上的异同。巴利语律典《衣犍度》中，佛陀应比丘请求允许向父母布施，虽未明确限定布施内容与场景，但语言表述特殊，且与经文中“比丘应如犀牛角般独来独往、不赡养他人”的教义看似矛盾。说一切有部律典《 Uttaragrantha》则明确规定，出家之子必须为父母提供衣食，详细说明不同经济状况下的赡养方式（如利用钵衣之外的财物、向施主乞讨、分享僧团所得或乞食所得），且该规定被充分整合进律典体系，在后续注释与律典手册中持续流传。通过对比两派律典及相关文献（如《本生经注》《 Katikāvatas》铭文），本文探讨赡养义务背后的社会文化因素（如婆罗门教对乞讨者的期待），并质疑将佛教比丘简单归为“僧侣”的合理性。  
关键词：比丘；赡养父母；上座部律典；说一切有部律典；佛教伦理  
Title：The Buddhist Bhikṣu’s Obligation to Support His Parent in Two Vinaya Traditions  
Author：Gregory Schopen  
Abstract：This article examines the provisions on Buddhist bhikkhus' obligation to support their parents in the Theravāda and Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinayas, revealing the similarities and differences between the two traditions. In the Cīvara-khandhaka of the Pāli Vinaya, the Buddha granted permission to a bhikkhu to give alms to his parents at his request. Although the content and context of the donation are not clearly limited, the linguistic expression is special, and it seems contradictory to the doctrinal statement in the suttas that "a bhikkhu should wander solitary as a rhinoceros horn and not support others". The Uttaragrantha of the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya explicitly stipulates that a son who has entered the religious life must provide food and clothing for his parents, detailing the ways of support under different economic conditions (such as using property beyond the bowl and robe, begging from donors, sharing what is obtained from the Saṅgha or alms-gathering). This provision is fully integrated into the Vinaya system and continues to circulate in subsequent commentaries and Vinaya handbooks. By comparing the Vinayas of the two traditions and related literature (such as the Jātaka Commentary and Katikāvatas inscriptions), this article explores the social and cultural factors behind the obligation to support parents (such as Brahmanical expectations of beggars) and questions the rationality of simply classifying Buddhist bhikkhus as "monks".

# 论文6. 注释、译文与词典：关于佛教与文献学的进一步思考
作者：E.G.卡尔斯（E.G. Kahrs）  
摘要：本文以K.R.诺曼《佛教的文献学研究方法》为基础，探讨本土注释者与译者的特定技巧和传统对巴利语词典编纂与文本解读的重要性。文章通过多个案例分析：其一，《批判巴利语词典》（CPD）对“udara-jivhāmaṃsa”的解读未充分参考本土注释，导致语义费解，而注释本明确其指“位于胃上方、形似舌头的肉块（脾脏）”；其二，通过巴尼尼语法中“kāraka”（参与者角色）与“lakāra”（动词后缀）理论，分析“udāna”“niruddhi”等词语的语义推导过程，揭示注释者为明确语义而构拟动词名词的现象；其三，对比梵语《胜天传说》与藏译本，指出藏译未能传达梵文本中基于词源分析的推理；最后，辨析“ārṣa”与“arthārṣa”的文本异读，说明文献学知识对还原文本原意的关键作用。  
关键词：佛教文献学；注释传统；文本翻译；词典编纂；巴利语语义  
Title：Commentaries, Translations, and Lexica: Some Further Reflections on Buddhism and Philology  
Author：E.G. Kahrs  
Abstract：Building on K.R. Norman's "A Philological Approach to Buddhism", this article explores the importance of the specific techniques and traditions of indigenous commentators and translators for Pāli lexicography and textual interpretation. The article analyzes through several cases: first, the interpretation of "udara-jivhāmaṃsa" in the Critical Pāli Dictionary (CPD) fails to fully refer to indigenous commentaries, resulting in obscure semantics, while the commentary clearly defines it as "a piece of flesh located above the stomach and shaped like a tongue (spleen)"; second, using the theories of "kāraka" (participant role) and "lakāra" (verbal suffix) in Pāṇinian grammar, it analyzes the semantic derivation process of words such as "udāna" and "niruddhi", revealing the phenomenon of commentators constructing verbal nouns to clarify semantics; third, comparing the Sanskrit legend of Śāntideva with its Tibetan translation, pointing out that the Tibetan translation fails to convey the etymology-based reasoning in the Sanskrit text; finally, distinguishing the textual variants of "ārṣa" and "arthārṣa", illustrating the key role of philological knowledge in restoring the original meaning of the text.

# 论文7. 关于《大史》25.110中“邪见”的札记
作者：P.S.杰尼（P.S. Jaini）  
摘要：本文聚焦《大史》第25章110节中“邪见”（micchādiṭṭhi）一词的含义，结合佛教与耆那教文献解读该词在战场死亡语境中的特殊所指。《大史》记载，杜达伽摩尼王因战争中杀戮众多而深陷悔恨，八位阿罗汉安慰他称，仅有“一个半人”真正被杀（一位受三归依者、一位受五戒者），其余死者皆为“邪见者与恶行之人，与牲畜无异”。传统将“邪见”译为“无信仰者”，但作者通过《中部》《相应部》等巴利语圣典指出，“邪见”的核心含义并非否定佛教信仰，而是指战士所持的“战死可生天”的错误认知——这与《相应部·战士相应》中佛陀对“邪见”的定义一致。文章进一步对比耆那教经典《Viyāhapannatti》中关于战场死亡的记载，发现两派沙门传统均认为持此类邪见者死后堕入恶道，佐证了《大史》中“邪见”的特殊内涵。  
关键词：《大史》；邪见；战场死亡；佛教；耆那教  
Title：A Note on micchādiṭṭhi in Mahāvaṃsa 25.110  
Author：P.S. Jaini  
Abstract：This article focuses on the meaning of the term "micchādiṭṭhi" (wrong view) in Mahāvaṃsa 25.110, interpreting its special reference in the context of battlefield death by combining Buddhist and Jain literature. The Mahāvaṃsa records that King Duṭṭhagāmaṇi was deeply remorseful for killing many in the war, and eight arahants comforted him by saying that only "one and a half men" were truly killed (one who had taken the three refuges and one who had taken the five precepts), while the rest of the dead were "wrong-viewed and evil-doing persons, no different from beasts". Traditionally, "micchādiṭṭhi" is translated as "unbelievers", but the author points out through Pāli canonical texts such as the Majjhima-nikāya and Saṃyutta-nikāya that the core meaning of "micchādiṭṭhi" is not the denial of Buddhist faith, but the wrong cognition held by warriors that "dying in battle leads to rebirth in heaven"—which is consistent with the Buddha's definition of "micchādiṭṭhi" in the Saṃyutta-nikāya's Yodhājīva-saṃyutta. The article further compares the records of battlefield death in the Jain canonical text Viyāhapannatti, finding that both śramaṇa traditions believed that those holding such wrong views would be reborn in evil realms after death, confirming the special connotation of "micchādiṭṭhi" in the Mahāvaṃsa.

# 论文8. 巴利语中的缩略形式
作者：凯特·克罗斯比（Kate Crosby）  
摘要：本文系统考察巴利语文本中的缩略现象，分析其类型、功能与文化背景。巴利语的缩略形式包括重复内容的简化（如用“peyyāla”指代重复公式）、语义冗余信息的省略、列表内容的概括（如用“yāva(t) iti ādi”表示列举）、宗教符号的浓缩（如五音节“namo buddhāya”代表五蕴、佛陀等概念）、文本概要（如含“-samāsa”“-sāra”后缀的标题）、仪式提示语（如“namo tassa”省略完整皈依文）、关键词缩略（如瑜伽行派手册用单节诗概括仪式与冥想指令）、首字母缩写与离合诗等。这些缩略形式不仅服务于记忆与口传，还与宗教实践紧密相关，如通过缩略文本实现功德积累、借助符号化缩略获得护佑。文章结合手稿与文献实例，揭示缩略形式在巴利语宗教文本中的多重价值。  
关键词：巴利语；缩略形式；文本传播；宗教实践；记忆技巧  
Title：Saṅkhepasārasaṅgaha: Abbreviation in Pāli  
Author：Kate Crosby  
Abstract：This article systematically examines the abbreviation phenomena in Pāli texts, analyzing their types, functions, and cultural backgrounds. Abbreviative forms in Pāli include the simplification of repetitive content (such as using "peyyāla" to refer to repetitive formulas), the omission of semantically redundant information, the generalization of list content (such as using "yāva(t) iti ādi" to indicate enumeration), the condensation of religious symbols (such as the five-syllable "namo buddhāya" representing concepts like the five aggregates and the Buddha), text summaries (such as titles with suffixes "-samāsa" and "-sāra"), ritual prompts (such as "namo tassa" omitting the complete refuge formula), keyword abbreviations (such as yogācāra manuals summarizing ritual and meditation instructions in a single verse), acronyms and acrostics, etc. These abbreviative forms not only serve memory and oral transmission but are also closely related to religious practice, such as accumulating merit through abbreviated texts and obtaining protection through symbolic abbreviations. Combining manuscript and literary examples, the article reveals the multiple values of abbreviative forms in Pāli religious texts.

Title：Recent Japanese Studies in the Pāli Commentarial Literature: Since 1984  
Author：Sodo Mori  
Abstract：This article reviews the research achievements of Japanese academia on Pāli commentarial literature (Aṭṭhakathā) since 1984, dividing them into six categories: first, the Japanese translation of commentarial literature, including full or selected translations of works such as the Paramatthajotikā and Vibhangatthakatha, some of which are the first translations in the world; second, the historical study of Buddhist doctrine and thought, exploring topics such as the Buddha concept, Bodhisatta thought, merit transference, and the three-knowledge tradition based on commentarial literature, comparing Northern and Southern Buddhist texts; third, the philological source tracing of commentarial literature, classifying and sorting out the six major literary sources of comments, focusing on the study of unknown sources such as "lost Sinhalese commentaries" and "views of other schools"; fourth, the research on the authorship of commentarial literature, discussing issues such as the attribution of Buddhaghosa's works and the authorship disputes of works related to Dhammapāla; fifth, the comparative study with Northern sectarian texts, using commentarial literature to supplement early Buddhist content not recorded in Pāli suttas and Vinayas, facilitating the study of Indian Buddhist history; sixth, the comparative study with Mahāyāna texts and the study of Sri Lankan Mahāyāna, exploring the connection between Pāli commentaries and Mahāyāna thoughts such as the Yogācāra school. The article finally points out future research directions, including the textual research on the early layers of commentarial literature and the Japanese translation plan of all commentarial literature.
