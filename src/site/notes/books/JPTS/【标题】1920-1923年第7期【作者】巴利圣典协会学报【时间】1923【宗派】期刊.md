# 论文3.  佛教从基督教中借鉴了什么？
作者：T.W.里斯·戴维斯（T. W. Rhys Davids）  
摘要：本文围绕佛教与基督教的相似性展开探讨，旨在厘清基督教是否从佛教中借鉴相关元素。文章将相似点分为三类：创始人传记、修道院制度与公共崇拜、道德教义。通过对比佛陀与基督的生平传说、两教修道院的规训与仪式、伦理教导的核心内容，指出部分相似性源于两位创始人同为宗教改革者的相似境遇，以及早期信徒的英雄崇拜与时代文化特征，而非直接的教义借鉴。结合历史证据分析，认为尚无确切记录表明佛教徒曾前往欧洲或巴勒斯坦传播教义，早期基督教作者对佛教的了解模糊且有限，两教相似性的核心原因是人类道德追求与宗教发展的普遍规律。  
关键词：佛教；基督教；宗教对比；教义渊源；文化交流  
Title：What Has Buddhism Derived from Christianity?  
Author：T. W. Rhys Davids  
Abstract：This paper explores the similarities between Buddhism and Christianity, aiming to clarify whether Christianity borrowed relevant elements from Buddhism. The paper divides the similarities into three categories: the biographies of the founders, monastic systems and public worship, and moral teachings. By comparing the life legends of the Buddha and Christ, the rules and rituals of the monastic orders of the two religions, and the core content of ethical teachings, it points out that some similarities stem from the similar situations of the two founders as religious reformers, as well as the hero worship of early believers and the cultural characteristics of the era, rather than direct doctrinal borrowing. Based on the analysis of historical evidence, it is believed that there is no definite record that Buddhists traveled to Europe or Palestine to spread their teachings, and early Christian authors had a vague and limited understanding of Buddhism. The core reason for the similarities between the two religions lies in the universal laws of human moral pursuit and religious development.

# 论文4.  巴利圣典协会工作的里程碑
作者：里斯·戴维斯夫人（Mrs. Rhys Davids）  
摘要：本文宣告巴利圣典协会完成阿毗达磨藏七部经典及三部相关注释（归于觉音）的罗马字母编辑工作，将其视为协会发展的重要里程碑。文章列出了阿毗达磨藏经典与注释的编辑者、出版时间，回顾了四十余年的编纂历程，包括版本修订、火灾等意外导致的延误等细节。分析了这些文献的学术价值，指出其在因果关系分析、感官理论等方面的贡献，同时反思了阿毗达磨文献中繁琐的辩证与术语崇拜对原始佛教教义的遮蔽，强调需区分佛陀的核心教导与后世僧团的学术建构，为佛教研究提供了清晰的文献整理脉络与批判性视角。

Title：A Milestone in Pali Text Society Work  
Author：Mrs. Rhys Davids  
Abstract：This paper announces that the Pali Text Society has completed the Roman letter edition of the seven texts of the Abhidhamma Pitaka and three related commentaries (attributed to Buddhaghosa), regarding it as an important milestone in the Society's development. The paper lists the editors and publication dates of the Abhidhamma Pitaka texts and commentaries, reviews the more than forty years of compilation process, including details such as version revisions and delays caused by accidents like fires. It analyzes the academic value of these documents, pointing out their contributions to the analysis of causal relationships and sensory theory, and at the same time reflects on the obscuration of original Buddhist teachings by the cumbersome dialectics and terminology worship in Abhidhamma literature. It emphasizes the need to distinguish between the core teachings of the Buddha and the academic construction of later monastic orders, providing a clear literature sorting context and critical perspective for Buddhist studies.
